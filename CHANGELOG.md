# Changelog

## 0.33.2 - 2026-06-24

### Bug Fixes

- **iOS search field animation**: The toolbar's search-close transition (right-to-left slide) stuttered visibly, and the "Memos" title was delayed catching up. Three sources of main-thread invalidation during the animation window were removed:
  - `MemeGTDApp` no longer holds `NetworkMonitor.shared` / `SyncEngine.shared` with `@StateObject`; they are plain `private let` references so the App body does not re-evaluate on every `@Published` change from those singletons. Views that need to observe them still opt in via `@EnvironmentObject`.
  - `NetworkMonitor.pathUpdateHandler` now skips assigning `isOnline` when the value did not actually change, suppressing redundant `objectWillChange` emissions.
  - `MemoStore.bindToSyncEngine(_:)` is no longer called from `MemeGTDApp.task`; the Combine subscription that called `refreshFromCache` on every `didFinishSyncStep` is gone.
  - `WindowGroup` no longer applies `.modelContainer(AppDatabase.shared)`. No view uses `@Query` / `@Environment(\.modelContext)`; the `ModelContext` is passed manually to `SyncEngine` and `MemoStore`.
  - `MemoListViewModel.loadMemos` no longer calls `store?.refreshFromCache()` synchronously at the start of the function. That path is reused as the search field's `onSearch` close handler and the synchronous SwiftData read set `@Published` properties mid-frame.
  - After the API responds, `store?.persistToCache(_:)` is now deferred via `Task { @MainActor }` instead of running synchronously on the main thread. The local-network API often returned inside the 300 ms spring window; the per-row SwiftData upserts blocked the main thread and delayed the title.

## 0.33.1 - 2026-06-24

### New Features (completing 0.33.0)

- **Per-row sync indicator**: Memo and comment rows render a small clock icon for any pending state and a red warning glyph for conflicts, so the user can see at a glance which items have not yet reached the server.
- **Conflict resolution sheet**: When a pending PATCH/DELETE finds the memo missing on the server (404), the row is now flagged `.conflict` and the top banner turns red — "Sync paused — N conflicts. Tap to resolve." Tapping opens a sheet that offers, per memo, **Keep local** (re-create on the server as a new row with a fresh clientUuid) or **Discard** (accept the server's deletion).
- **Outbox detail sheet**: The banner is now tappable when anything is queued. The sheet lists every pending op (create / edit / delete for memos and comments) with a body excerpt, retry count, and last error. Per-row swipe-to-discard, plus "Retry all now" and "Discard all" actions. Discard rolls the LocalMemo / LocalComment back to a safe state (pendingCreate rows are removed; pendingUpdate / pendingDelete rows return to `.synced`).

## 0.33.0 - 2026-06-24

### New Features

- **iOS offline support for memos (Tier 1–3)**: Memos can now be browsed, created, edited, deleted, and commented on while the device is offline. Writes are persisted to a local SwiftData cache and queued in an Outbox; the SyncEngine drains the queue automatically when network returns. The first launch performs a one-time full pull so the user can browse every memo offline (Story 6). A minimal "Offline · N pending" banner shows status above the memo list.
- **`client_uuid` on POST /api/memos and POST /api/memos/:id/comments**: Optional UUID v4 field used by offline-capable clients to make writes idempotent — retries with the same `client_uuid` return the original row instead of duplicating it. Web and CLI clients are unaffected (field is optional, default behavior unchanged).

### Database

- New migration `014_add_client_uuid.sql` adds a nullable `client_uuid` column on `issues` and `comments` with a partial UNIQUE index (`WHERE client_uuid IS NOT NULL`), so existing NULL-only rows do not collide.

## 0.32.1 - 2026-06-23

### Bug Fixes

- **iOS Memo Loading Indicator Stuck**: `loadMemos` / `loadAllMemos` left `isLoading` at `true` when cancelled, on the assumption that a replacement reload task would take over the spinner. Cancellations from outside that path (e.g. SwiftUI tearing down the `.task` when the `ScrollView` `.id` flips, or any other view-driven `.task` cancel) had no replacement, so the "Loading memos…" overlay could remain on screen indefinitely. Both methods now clear `isLoading` via `defer` so the spinner is always released.

## 0.32.0 - 2026-06-18

### New Features

- **`GET /api/memos` accepts `order=asc|desc`**: Lets clients fetch memos in ascending creation order. Default remains `desc` (newest first) so existing consumers are unaffected.

### Behavior Changes

- **iOS Memo Schedule Filter**: When a schedule (created-date range) filter is active, the memo timeline now fetches the range in ascending order (oldest first) and loads the full filtered range. The oldest entry is the natural top of the list — no programmatic scrolling, so wide ranges open instantly instead of waiting for an animated scroll through hundreds of cells. Pull-to-refresh while the filter is active reloads the full range. Loading the whole range trades a short delay for completeness.

### Reliability

- **iOS Memo Reload Race Fix**: Filter changes while a full-range load is in flight now cancel the prior load to keep the timeline consistent. When the server reports a higher `total` than it actually returns, the list now settles `hasMore` to false so "No older memos" appears correctly.

## 0.31.0 - 2026-06-13

### New Features

- **Production DB safety guards** (Issue #48 follow-up):
  - `MGTD_ENV=test` now refuses to run when the resolved DB path is inside the production data directory (`~/.local/share/mgtd/`). `pnpm mgtd:test` and `pnpm server:dev` set it automatically.
  - `DB_PATH` is now honored even when the config file is missing (previously this silently fell back to the production database).
- **Database backup**:
  - New `mgtd db backup` command using SQLite's online backup API (WAL-safe, generation-managed pruning via `--keep`, `--list`, `--output`).
  - The API server now takes automatic periodic backups (`MGTD_BACKUP_ENABLED` / `MGTD_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` / `MGTD_BACKUP_KEEP` / `MGTD_BACKUP_DIR`).
  - `mgtd db migrate` pre-migration backups now use the online backup API instead of a plain file copy (which missed uncheckpointed WAL content) and are stored in `<db dir>/backups`.
- **Health check**: New `GET /api/health` endpoint reporting server version, uptime, and database connectivity (503 when the database is unreachable).
- **Log file output**: Optional `MGTD_LOG_FILE` writes JSON logs to a file with daily rotation (7 generations kept) in addition to stdout.
- **Process management**: systemd user unit template at `deploy/systemd/mgtd-api.service`; operational runbook in `docs/operations.md`.

### Behavior Changes

- `mgtd init --force` on an existing database now requires `--yes` in non-interactive mode (scripts, CI, AI agents) and shows a confirmation prompt on a TTY. Non-interactive overwrites without `--yes` exit with status 1.

## 0.30.0 - 2026-04-24

### New Features

- **Memo-to-Task Promotion (Web + iOS + CLI + API)**: Promote an existing memo to a task with all its context preserved
  - New `GET /api/memos/{id}/promote-preview` endpoint returns the task body that would be produced by promotion (memo body with comments inlined under a `## コメント` section). Web UI, iOS, and the `mgtd memo promote` CLI all use this single server-owned formatter to pre-fill the promotion editor.
  - `POST /api/memos/{id}/promote` now accepts optional `bodyMd`, `taskKind`, `scheduledStart`, `scheduledEnd`, `isAllDay`, and the full `TaskStatus` enum (including `done` and `canceled`). When `bodyMd` is omitted, the server builds the body via the same formatter as the preview; when supplied, the caller's body is used verbatim.
  - Promotion automatically carries over memo labels, project memberships, and outgoing/incoming links to the new task.
  - iOS "Promote to Task" action in the memo detail bottom sheet is a single atomic POST (no more two-step POST+PATCH).

  - `LinkItem.tsx`: Individual link display with delete functionality
  - `AddLinkInline.tsx`: Multi-step inline form for link creation
- **New Types** (packages/web/src/types/links.ts):
  - `LinkDisplayItem`: Link data with target issue info and direction
  - `LinkCreationState`: Form state management for creation flow
  - `LinkType`, `Direction`: Type definitions for link types and directions
- **New Utilities** (packages/web/src/utils/linkIcons.tsx):
  - `getLinkIcon()`: SVG icon components for each link type and direction
  - `getLinkLabel()`: Human-readable labels for link types
  - `getDirectionArrow()`: Direction indicator arrows
- **Integration** (packages/web/src/components/ItemDetail.tsx):
  - Added `LinkSection` between Labels and Body sections
  - Self-contained component following CommentSection pattern

### User Experience

- **GitHub-inspired UX**: Follows GitHub's sub-issues pattern with inline interactions
- **No modals**: All operations (create, delete) use inline forms and confirmations
- **Consistent styling**: Matches existing Web UI design with TailwindCSS
- **Mobile responsive**: Responsive flex layouts for all screen sizes
- **Performance**: Optimized with React hooks and minimal re-renders

### API Requirements

- Requires API server with link management endpoints (added in v0.6.0)
- Uses `/api/issues/:id/links` with target issue information (v0.7.0)
- Compatible with link type filtering and validation (v0.7.0)

## 0.7.0 - 2025-10-22

### New Features

- **Link Validation Enhancements (FR-013, FR-014)**: Enhanced link creation with hierarchy integrity validations
  - **Circular hierarchy detection (FR-013)**: Prevents creating cycles in parent-child relationships
    - Blocks circular links like A→B→C→A that would corrupt task hierarchies
    - Uses Recursive CTE to traverse ancestor chains up to 10 levels deep
    - Only applies to `parent` and `child` link types; `relates` and `derived_from` can still form cycles
    - Error message: "Circular relationship detected: Creating this link would form a cycle in the parent-child hierarchy"
  - **Inverse duplicate prevention (FR-014)**: Prevents bidirectional parent-child relationships
    - Blocks inverse links like A parent of B + B parent of A
    - Provides more specific error for 2-node cycles than circular detection
    - Only applies to `parent` and `child` link types; `relates` links remain bidirectional by nature
    - Error message: "Cannot create inverse parent-child link: Issue #X is already a Y of Issue #Z"
  - **Validation order**: Self-ref → Source exists → Target exists → Duplicate → Inverse (V5) → Circular (V6)

- **API Feature Parity: Link Type Filtering**: Added `?type=` query parameter to `GET /api/issues/:id/links`
  - Filter links by type: `?type=parent`, `?type=child`, `?type=relates`, `?type=derived_from`
  - Returns 400 error for invalid type values (validated by Zod schema)
  - Achieves full feature parity with CLI `mgtd link list --type` command
  - Example: `GET /api/issues/5/links?type=parent` returns only parent links

- **API Enhancement: Target Issue Information**: Enhanced `GET /api/issues/:id/links` to include target issue details
  - Response now includes `targetIssue` object with `id`, `type`, and `title` fields
  - Eliminates need for additional API calls to fetch target issue information
  - Uses optimized single SQL query to fetch all target issues (avoids N+1 problem)
  - For tasks: title is taken from the task's title field
  - For memos: title is taken from first 100 characters of body_md
  - Enables Web UI to display linked issues with titles without separate API calls

### Implementation Details

- **Database Layer** (packages/db/src/linkRepository.ts):
  - Added `findInverseParentChildLink()`: Detects inverse parent-child relationships
  - Added `hasAncestor()`: Uses Recursive CTE to detect circular hierarchies with depth limit
  - Exported new validation functions from index.ts

- **Service Layer** (packages/core/src/linkService.ts):
  - Enhanced `create()` method with two new validations (V5, V6)
  - Validation runs only for hierarchical types (`parent`, `child`)
  - Non-hierarchical types (`relates`, `derived_from`) skip new validations

- **API Layer** (packages/api):
  - Added `ListLinksQuerySchema` for type filtering
  - Updated `listLinksHandler` to accept and apply query filters
  - Updated route schema with querystring validation and 400 error case
  - Enhanced `LinkWithDirectionSchema` to include `targetIssue` object
  - Modified `listLinksHandler` to fetch target issue information in single SQL query
  - SQL query uses `COALESCE(title, SUBSTR(body_md, 1, 100))` to handle both tasks and memos

### Tests

- **Database Layer**: 47 tests passing (added 3 hasAncestor unit tests)
- **Core Layer**: 33 tests passing (added 8 validation tests)
- **CLI Layer**: 7 tests passing
- **API Layer**: 107 tests passing (added 5 type filtering tests, 1 targetIssue test)
- **Total**: 194 tests passing ✅

### Performance

- Circular detection adds ~20-50ms per parent/child link creation (Recursive CTE query)
- Inverse duplicate check adds <5ms per parent/child link creation (direct SQL query)
- Non-hierarchical links (`relates`, `derived_from`) have no performance impact

### Breaking Changes

None. All enhancements are backward compatible:
- Existing links are grandfathered (not retroactively validated)
- New validations only apply to newly created parent/child links
- API query parameter is optional (defaults to no filtering)

## 0.6.0 - 2025-10-21

### New Features

- **Comment count in list endpoints**: Added `commentCount` field to GET /api/memos and GET /api/tasks responses
  - List endpoints now include the number of non-deleted comments for each memo/task
  - Individual endpoints (GET /api/memos/:id) do not include commentCount as comments are fetched separately
  - Implemented using efficient SQL subquery aggregation to avoid N+1 queries
  - Database layer: Updated `listMemos()` and `listTasks()` to calculate commentCount
  - API layer: Created separate schemas (`MemoListItemSchema`, `TaskListItemSchema`) for list responses
  - All tests passing (DB: 44, Core: 25, API: 101)
